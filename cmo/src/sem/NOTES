Parallel programming model
. Copy list of files to all nodes (not using MPI?)
	sem_setup
. Fork/exec VMWare on all nodes
	sem_setup
. Launch MW <directory> <outfile>
  - Run script to rename all *.in.mw files to *.in
	sem_get_tasks
  - Run script to list all *.in files into file sem_server_inputs
	sem_get_tasks
  - Read sem_server_inputs
  - Create a queue of jobs, renaming *.in files to *.in.mw
  - Work on queue until gone
  - Iterate
. Kill VMWare child
	sem_cleanup


Need to make this more robust to missing files (command files)
Need to create a worker setup and worker cleanup
	Launch worker_setup when workers are setup
	Launch worker_cleanup when workers are cleaned up
Graceful degredation if file cannot be executed
