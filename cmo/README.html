CMO

CMO performs protein-structure comparison using a contact-map-overlap
metric. CMO allows users to perform large-scale comparisons using parallel
resources to get both lower and upper-bounds on the CMO metric.

Overview.

Protein-structure comparison is typically performed using a heuristic
comparison metric that measures the similarity between structural
components of proteins.  The contact-map-overlap metric compares the
overlap between the contact-map for each protein.  The overlap is measured
by considering all possible alignments of the amino acids of the two
proteins. Solving this problem exactly is NP-hard, but upper bounds on
the overlap can be computed using linear programming techniques, and
lower bounds can be heuristically computed with meta-heuristics like
evolutionary algorithms.

CMO provides a facility for setting up and solving large-scale protein
structure comparisons using distributed computing resources. The basic
CMO code is quite simple, but it leverages and integrates a variety of
optimization and parallel algorithm libraries.

Installation.

No configuration or makefile facilities are provided with CMO.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependencies

This code was compiled using makefiles from the PICO optimization
library. However, it should be easy to compile this on many different
platforms.

CMO directly depends upon the following libraries:

  PICO   - linear programming interface
  SGOPT  - evolutionary algorithms
  MW-SNL - MW master-worker framework

Additionally, CMO indirectly depends on the following software libraries:

  UTILIB          - C++ utility library (for PICO and SGOPT)
  CPLEX or SOPLEX - linear programming

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Platforms.

This package is quite generic and thus it should compile on a wide range
of platforms.  Specifically, this code has been compiled on RedHat Linux,
and SOLARIS CC 5.2+ and g++ 3.x.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Versions.

This release is version 1.0.
